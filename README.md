## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I improved on my skills of working with the media queries property in CSS and working with colors using hsl
- I also learnt how to add fonts from other sources e.g. google

```css
body{
  background-color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
}

@media (min-width: 375px){
      .container{
        height: auto;
        min-width: 375px;
      }
    }
```

### Continued development

- I would love to focus on building responsive web pages and learning more CSS properties.
